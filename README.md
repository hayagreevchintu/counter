# Counter

This is a basic Vanilla JS project where a count value is updated and displayed on screen when a button is clicked. 

If the count value is negative, the value would be displayed in red. If it is positive, it would be displayed in green. If it is 0, the value would be displayed in black.

I have followed John Smilga's Vannila JS projects tutorial on YouTube and built this page. I have not designed the CSS. I have only built the JavaScript functionality(app.js) and added the html elements to their corresponding classes after referring to styles.css to gain a better understanding and grasp on my JS skills.

app.js and server.js is Open Source. Feel free to use this code as a reference for your projects but please give me credits, coz, let's agree, leaching sucks!
